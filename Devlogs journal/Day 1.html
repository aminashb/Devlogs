<h1>Finished the Introdution to html</h1>
<h2>19/05/2024</h2>
<p>Today is not my first day coding with html or learning it, it is actually the last day of the introduction to html, meaning that it is the beginning of actually experimenting programming by myself. Tomorrow is the start of learning CSS which is so exciting, this what I was looking for since the beginning of the course, the combination of design and code, the ultimate designing programming language CSS!!

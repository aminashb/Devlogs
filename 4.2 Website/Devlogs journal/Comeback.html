<h1>Back after a YEAR!</h1>
<h2>19/05/2025</h2>
<p>It has been a year since I last wrote in this journal, and I am back to continue my journey in web development.
    <br/>
    I just finished my first year of uni, I signed up for a web design and development course same time last year. We have been doing a lot of backend development rather than frontend, which is interesting, but I feel like the pace was very slow, so I'm back to do the full-stack web development course, and inshallah finish it by mid-july or august.
    <br/>
    This time I'm more aware of what the course is about, as I've been doing a lot of research and reading about web development since last year, I also have been going through the lessons I've already done to refresh my memory. I am hoping to do a couple of projects throughout the summer and improve my cv, I'm still not sure of whether I want a coorporate job or to be a freelancer, but I am hoping to be working on something along side my studies when I start my second year in uni.
    <br/>
    I have no promises for a daily journal entry, but I will try to write as much as I can, and hopefully I will be able to keep up with the course and finish it on time.
